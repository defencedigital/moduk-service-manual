Anyone working on technology and services in Defence can join the user-centred design (UCD) community. 

## Who you will meet

In this community, you will meet:

- content designers and people who publish content
- interaction and graphic designers
- product owners interested in user-centred design
- service and product designers
- user researchers and data analysts

## Get feedback

You can ask the user-centred design community to give you feedback on your service, a new feature or an issue. 

For example, you have a new feature and you are not sure which GOV.UK or Defence design patterns you should use. 

Check [how to ask for and give feedback](/your-community/ask-for-and-give-feedback).

## Join community calls

We run a monthly UCD call. We discuss topics like accessibility, tools available in Defence and cross-government collaboration.

We also run regular calls for content designers, interaction designers and user researchers. 

You need to work in the Ministry of Defence to join community calls. 

Using your Ministry of Defence email, [ask to join the community calls](mailto:UKStratCom-DD-Foundry-UCD-UX@mod.gov.uk?subject=Join%20UCD%20community%20calls). 

Include your full name, your role and the project you are working on.
