There are communities of practice for people working in similar roles across Defence.

## Why join a community

Joining a community helps you:

- learn from what other projects are doing
- be confident that you are meeting service standards
- use common approaches and shared tools

## Join communities in Defence

Anyone working in Defence can join a community. 

You can join more than one of these communities:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/your-community/product/">product</a></li>

  <li><a href="/your-community/software-development/">software development</a></li>

  <li><a href="/your-community/user-centred-design/">user-centred design</a></li>
</ul>

If you have a community in Defence that meets regularly, we can share the details here. Find out how to [get in touch](/get-in-touch/).
