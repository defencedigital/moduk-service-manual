There are communities of practice for people working in similar roles across Defence.

## Why join a community

Joining a community helps you:

- learn from what other projects are doing
- be confident that you are meeting service standards
- use common approaches and shared tools

## Join communities in Defence

Anyone working in Defence can join a community. 

You can join more than one community.

- [Product](/your-community/product/)
- [Software development](/your-community/software-development/)
- [User-centred design](/your-community/user-centred-design/)

If you have a community in Defence that meets regularly, we can share the details here. Find out how to [get in touch](/get-in-touch/).
