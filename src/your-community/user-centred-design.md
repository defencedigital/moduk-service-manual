Anyone working on digital services in Defence can join the user-centred design (UCD) community. 

## Who you will meet

In this community, you will meet:

- user researchers and data analysts
- service designers and product designers
- interaction and graphic designers
- content designers, managers and strategists
- product managers and business analysts working with users

## Community calls

Join the UCD community call on the third Thursday of the month at 2pm.

Calls are 55 minutes. We discuss things like accessibility, tools available in Defence and cross-government collaboration.

### Ask for an invitation

You need to work in the Ministry of Defence to join community calls. 

Using your Ministry of Defence email, send a message to: [UKStratCom-DD-Foundry-UCD-UX@mod.gov.uk](mailto:UKStratCom-DD-Foundry-UCD-UX@mod.gov.uk?subject=Join%20UCD%20community%20calls). 

Include your full name, your role and the project you are working on.

## Get feedback

You can ask the user-centred design community to give you feedback on your service, a new feature or an issue. 

For example, you have a new feature and you are not sure which GOV.UK or Defence design patterns you should use. 

Check [how to ask for and give feedback](/your-community/ask-for-and-give-feedback).
