Ready for review. Fact check what we have and describe what is missing.

Every technology and service that handles Defence data needs to be Secure by Design. This includes projects delivered by suppliers.

## Projects this applies to

Since July 2023, new technology infrastructure and digital services in Defence need to follow the Secure by Design approach. Examples include: 

- networks
- applications
- services
- platforms
- weapons systems

If your project has existing security accreditation, you need to move to Secure by Design when it expires. Start preparing for it now.

## Who is responsible

Everyone on your team is responsible for keeping your technology or service secure. However, you need to appoint a Senior Responsible Owner (SRO).

If you do not have an SRO, someone in your team needs to take on the role. For example, your product or service owner.

Your SRO needs to be someone with experience in risk management. If you do not have someone suitable, your project sponsor can be your SRO.

SROs are usually supported by security and delivery leads.  


## Get your team involved

Secure by Design encourages everyone to identify and manage risk. Make sure your team understands:

- the project is responsible for cyber security
- why designing for security from the start is important
- their role in keeping MOD data secure
