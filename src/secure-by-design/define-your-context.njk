          <p style="color:green">Ready for review. Fact check what we have and describe what is missing.</p> 

          <p>Your approach to cyber security depends on what your technology or service does.</p>
          
          <p>For example, a service that stores personal information will need to be more secure than [ xxxx xxxxx xxxx].</p>

          <h2 id="what-you-do-and-why">What you do and why</h2>

          <p>You should be able to describe what your technology or service is and why Defence needs it.</p>
          
          <p>You also need to know who your users will be and what their needs are. Document what you know and add more details as you go. </p>

          <p>Look in your business case, concept of operation and user requirement documents. If you do not have these, create them and include considerations for security.</p>
          
          <ul class="govuk-list"> 
          <li>Follow <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/considering-security-within-the-business-case" target="_blank">GOV.UK advice on adding security to your business case<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</li>

          </ul>

            <h2 id="what-you-need-to-protect">What you need to protect</h2>
            
            <p>Create a detailed list of things you need to protect, such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>networks</li>
              <li>information and data</li>
              <li>documentation</li>
              <li>intellectual property</li>
              <li>reputation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Your technology or service might need to protect assets that are not listed here. Consider how your technology or service is designed and your ways of working.</p>

            <p>Not all assets need the same level of protection. Identify your critical assets, they might need more protection. Work with stakeholders and your security community to agree the importance of each asset.</p>

            {{ component('inset-text', {
            text: 'Keep your list of assets updated, adding more details as your technology or service matures.'
            }) }}
            
            <p>Follow <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/documenting-service-assets" target="_blank">GOV.UK guidance on documenting assets<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>

            <h3>Check existing lists</h3>

            <p>The Ministry of Defence keeps lists of some assets that need to be protected. To find out more, <a ref="">contact CySAAS</a>.</p>

            <p>You should also <a href="/secure-by-design/agree-your-security-controls/">check existing threat assessments</a>.</p>
               
            <h3>Consider all types of information</h3>

            <p>Your information is probably held in digital form. It might also be produced on paper or end up in a physical system, such as in a weapon or a radio transmitter.</p>
            
            <p>Information in Defence is classified OFFICIAL, SECRET or TOP-SECRET. When you map your information, you also need to consider:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>confidentiality - who can access what </li>
              <li>integrity - keeping information correct</li>
              <li>availability - getting information at the right time</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Find out <a href="/security-classifications/">how to classify information</a>.

            <h2 id="map-how-information-is-used">Map how information is used</h2>

            <p>Create a map of how information is used across the life of your technology or service. This helps you:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>understand what happens to information at different stages</li>
              <li>focus on information that needs protecting the most</li>
              <li>choose appropriate security controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Make it visual</h3>

            <p>Do not create a spreadsheet. You need to show how information flows through your technology or service.</p>

            <p>Choose a tool to help you create a flow diagram, model or schema. For example, Microsoft Visio is available on MODNET.</p>

            <p>You need to show which state information is in. Information can be:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>at rest, for example in storage</li>
              <li>in transit, for example in a communications network</li>
              <li>being processed by a computer or a human</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember to map all of your information from concept and design to retirement. Start with what you know and add details as you go.</p> 

            <h3>Look at the wider picture</h3>

            <p>Your technology or service does not work in isolation. You need to know how it fits in the Ministry of Defence's existing technical architecture. </p>

            <p>On your map, show all connecting systems and organisations. This helps you:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>identify teams and systems you rely on</li>
              <li>recover faster from security incidents</li>
              <li>contribute to keeping Defence secure </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="agree-your-boundary">Agree your boundary</h2>

            <p>Your technology or service has a defined scope, this includes the things you are responsible for.</p>
            
            <p>Often, technologies and services need to connect to other systems. Putting an agreed boundary on your map helps you:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>define what is in your control</li>
              <li>identify areas of risk</li>
              <li>check if you need authorisation to do something</li>
              <li>share information and updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work with system stakeholders</h3>

            <p>You cannot set your authorisation boundary on your own. Work with system stakeholders and enterprise architects to agree who owns risk on either side of the boundary.</p>

            {{ component('inset-text', {
            text: 'If you assume a risk is the responsibility of another team, you create a security vulnerability.'
            }) }}

            <h3>Getting agreement</h3>

            <p>Get agreement from everyone involved. Include the names of people who formally accept each risk. Regularly check that names are still correct.</p>

            <p>If you cannot get agreement on your boundary, you need to check your organisation's risk management process.</p>

            <p>For help getting agreement across Top Level Budgets (TLBs), on MODNET you can <a href="https://iss-services-portal.tpmhub.r.mil.uk/dwp/app/#/catalog" target="_blank">ask for support<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>ask for support. </p>
