            <p>Your team needs to put the right controls in place to identify and manage security risks.</p>

            <h2 id="consider-your-context">Consider your context</h2>

            <p>Use controls that are appropriate for what you need to protect and how much risk is acceptable.</p>

            <p>If you set too many controls, people might find it difficult to use your technology or service. For example [xxxxxx  does not need xxxxxx xxxxx].</p>

            <p>If you do not have enough or the right controls, you might create security vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>Find out <a href="">how to agree your security controls</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="review-your-designs">Review your designs</h2>

            <p>Design your technology or service so that you need fewer security controls. </p>
            
            <p>For example if people do not need to access the internet to use your service, you do not need to add a firewall. </p>
            
            <p>Get your team involved in security design discussions. You can also ask other teams in Defence to share their designs for mitigating risk.</p>

             <h2 id="map-controls-against-risks">Map controls against risks</h2>

            <p>Run a team workshop to agree which controls you need to use.</p>

            <p>You need to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>describe why the controls are right for your technology or service</li>
              <li>list your controls and the risks they will manage</li>
              <li>create [high level control documentation] that the team can access and your stakeholders can understand</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can <a href="" target="_blank">check what to include in your list of controls<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>

            <h3>Think about different kinds of controls</h3>

            <p>Security controls can be administrative, physical or technical. For example, people might need to use a laptop in a building with open wifi. Or, people might use electronic door locks to enter a building.</p>
            
            <p>Technical security controls include things like:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>encryption</li>
              <li>firewalls</li>
              <li>anti-virus software</li>
              <li>data backups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/agreeing-a-security-controls-set-for-your-service" target="_blank">GOV.UK guidance on security controls<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. The guidance includes a template with example controls.</p>

            <h3>Check your organisation's controls</h3>

            <p>Many top level budgets have [tailored control baselines] and existing controls that you can use. Check if your organisation has these. If they do, reuse what you can.</p>
            <p>Depending on the systems you use, you might need to set some mandatory controls. Check with the owners of all the systems you use.</p>
            
            <h3>Check threat assessments</h3>

            <p>Like most organisations, Defence has details of the threats we face. You have to work for the Ministry of Defence to access these. On MODNET, search for '[check the search term]'.</p>

            <p>If your technology or service is part of a larger programme, ask the programme if they have done a threat assessment. You can use it to help set your controls.</p>

            <p>You can <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/sourcing-a-threat-assessment" target="_blank">check GOV.UK guidance on threat assessments<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
