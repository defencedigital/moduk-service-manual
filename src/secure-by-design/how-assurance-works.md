Your team is responsible for managing cyber security risks in your technology or service. You no longer apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time. 

## Assess your security

To be Secure by Design, you need to keep checking that your technology or service is secure. 

How often you do assessments depends on your technology or service, but you need to do one at least every 3 months.

You must also do a risk assessment when you make changes or discover new threats.

When you do your assessments, use the Cyber Activity and Assurance Tracker (CAAT). It helps you follow Secure by Design best practice in Defence. You get a report that you can share with your team and stakeholders.

Find out [more about self-assessments and CAAT](). 

### Independent assessments

The Cyber Security Assurance and Advisory Service (CySAAS) team looks at random assessment reports submitted by projects. This helps make sure teams are being consistent. 

If your project is a priority and considered high risk, you might be selected for an assessment.  

You can ask CySAAS to check how you are doing at major milestones, for example before an investment appraisal. CySAAS has to deal with priority projects first. 

You can [ask CySAAS if they can help]().


## Give regular updates

You need to give stakeholders confidence that you are keeping your technology or service secure. 

Make security part of your existing governance and meetings. For example, add a security update to the agenda for your project boards. You will also need to create and maintain a risk register. 

Anyone on your team can report on security but your Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) is accountable. 

Check [who can be an SRO](/secure-by-design-phases/who-needs-to-do-this).
