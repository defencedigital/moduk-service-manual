            <h2 id="check-the-skills-in-your-team-team">Check the skills in your team</h2>

            <p>Make sure you have someone on your team who can:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>identify and report vulnerabilities</li>
              <li>suggest how to mitigate security risks</li>
              <li>advise on your team's approach to security </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The kind of experience this person needs depends on your technology or service. For example, if you plan to use cloud technologies you need someone in your team who understands the risks of using cloud.</p>

            <h3 id="check-the-skills-in-your-team-team">Finding people</h3>

            <p>Talk to your commercial team about getting someone with security experience. Ask them if you can use services existing services, including:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6249" target="_blank">Digital and IT Professional Services (DIPS)<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></li>

            <h2 id="appoint-an-owner">Appoint an owner</h2>

            <p>If you do not have a Senior Responsible Officer (SRO), someone in your team needs to take on the role. For example, your product or service owner.</p>
            
            <p>Your SRO is accountable for the overall security of your technology or service. They need experience in risk management.</p>
            
            <p>If you do not have someone suitable, your sponsor can be your SRO.</p>
         
            <h2 id="agree-who-does-what">Agree who does what</h2>

            <p>Some people need to do specific activities. You need to decide who is responsible and accountable for Secure by Design activities.</p>
            
            <p>For example, developers are responsible for writing secure code. A delivery lead makes sure developers have the skills and time to write secure code. The delivery lead is accountable.</p>

            <p>Check <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/guidance/secure-by-design/activities/agreeing-roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">GOV.UK guidance on roles and responsibilities<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.

            <h2 id="know-who-your-stakeholders-are">Know who your stakeholders are </h2>
            
            <p>Make a list of the people and organisations you need to keep updated on security.</p>

            <p>Inside the Ministry of Defence, your stakeholders can include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>top level budgets</li>
              <li>sponsors</li>
              <li>governance boards</li>

            <p>Outside the Ministry of Defence, your stakeholders can include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>suppliers</li>
              <li>customers</li>
              <li>other government departments</li>
              <li>regulatory bodies, for example the Information Commissioner's Office</li>
