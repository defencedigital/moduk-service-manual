By designing security into projects from the start, you help Defence stay ahead of adversaries and maintain national security.  

## Across government

The UK Cabinet Office policy is that all government departments and arm's length bodies must be secure. 

Following a Secure by Design approach, government departments will: 

- help create resilient technology and services
- make security everyone’s responsibility
- improve trust and data sharing

## Secure by Design in Defence

The Ministry of Defence is implementing Secure by Design in all top level budgets and arm’s length bodies.

All technology and services that handle Defence data must follow Secure by Design. This includes projects delivered by suppliers.
 
### What you need to do

Your team is responsible for managing cyber security risks and doing self assessments. You do not have to apply for security accreditation that lasts for a period of time.

For your technology or service to be secure, your team needs to:

- consider cyber security from the start
- choose appropriate security frameworks and controls
- do regular self assessments
- continuously manage risks

### Follow the guidance

Check the activities you need to do and the tools you can use. Follow the Secure by Design guidance: 
 
- [get the basics right]()
- [assess your risks]()
- [manage your risks]()
