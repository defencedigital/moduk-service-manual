          <p style="color:green">Content ready for review. Fact check what we have.</p> 
          
            <p>You need to check that your technology or service is secure.</p>
            
            <p>Do security testing in all phases of your project and when you discover new threats.</p>

            <h2 id="start-securely">Start securely</h2>

            <p>Design your technology or service so that it is secure. Put best practices in place so that you do not have to fix issues later. Consider things like:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>your technical architecture</li>
              <li>using secure code libraries</li>
              <li>meeting coding standards</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Review your designs regularly, especially when you make changes or discover new threats.<p>

            <p>Follow <a href="#0">guidance on Secure by Design</a>.</p>
            <p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice" target="_blank">GOV.UK Technology Code of Practice<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
         
            <h2 id="security-testing-in-Defence">Security testing in Defence</h2>

            <p>You can do different kinds of security testing. Decide on the mix of approaches that is right for your technology or service.</p>

            <h3>Code reviews</h3>

            <p>You need to test your code. Make automated and manual tests part of your release process. Do code reviews during development and before committing new code. </p>
            
            <p>Code reviews help you find and fix vulnerabilities. They also help you meet coding standards.</p>

            <h3>Vulnerability assessments</h3>
            
            <p>Use automated tools to pick up errors and vulnerable libraries. Examples of automated tools include Nessus, Rapid7 and Qualys.</p>

            <p>After you run automated tests, ask a security expert to check for vulnerabilities that are harder to find. If you do not have a security expert on your team, check <a href="">guidance on involvoing the right people</a>.</p>

            <p>Do a vulnerability assessment before you release code, including updates.</p>

            <h3>Penetration testing</h3>

            <p>Depending on what you find in your vulnerability assessment, you might need to do penetration (pen) testing. You should also consider doing a pen test after you release significant changes.</p>

            <p>During a penetration (pen) test, security experts simulate a cyber attack on your technology or service. Using automated and manual techniques, they find vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.</p>

            <p>Ask your commercial team if you should use security experts in Defence or an external company. If you use an external company, they should be a verified supplier. Check the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/products-services/verify-suppliers?scheme=CHECK+Penetration+Testing" target="_blank">National Cyber Security Centre's register<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>

            <p>Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/vulnerability-and-penetration-testing" target="_blank">GOV.UK guidance on vulnerability and penetration testing<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>

            <h3>Bug bounties</h3>
            
            <p>You can ask ethical hackers to try and exploit your technology or service over a period of time. The hackers are paid for each valid vulnerability that they find. Bug bounties often find vulnerabilities that other approaches miss.</p>

            <p>Only use bug bounties after you have done other kinds of security testing. You can hold a bug bounty remotely or onsite to test systems that do not use the internet.</p>

            <h3>Vulnerability Disclosure Programmes</h3>

            <p>If your technology or service is online, consider running a Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP). VDPs give ethical hackers a way to report vulnerabilities at any time.</p>

            <p>A well run VDP helps you identify vulnerabilities and mitigate them before they can be exploited.</p>

            <p>The Ministry of Defence has a Vulnerability Rewards Programme for selected ethical hackers. To find out more, search for 'xxxxxxx' on MODNET.</p>
            
            <h3>Red teaming</h3>

            <p>Red teaming involves skilled, ethical hackers breaking into your technology or service however they can. This includes exploiting physical and human weaknesses, for example phishing.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, read teaming happens without your team knowing. It tests how you respond to real world attacks.</p>

            <p>Only use red teaming now and again, after you have done other kinds of security testing.</p>
            
            <h2 id="share-what-you-find">Share what you find</h2>

            <p>Whenever you do security testing, share what you find with your team and your stakeholders. Do this even if you find no vulnerabilities. It gives stakeholders confidence that your technology or service is as secure as it can be.</p>

            <p>Add vulnerabilities that you find to your project's risk register. Include enough information for the team to decide how to mitigate risks. Make sure you track how vulnerabilities are being managed.</p>
            
            <p>If you do not find any vulnerabilities, share this with stakeholders. It gives them confidence that your technology or service is as secure as it can be.</p>

            <h2 id="ask-for=support">Ask for support</h2>

            <p>Before you ask for support, make sure your team has done a mix of security testing.</p>

            <h3>Technical security teams</h3>

            <p>If your project is used in military operations, you can use a technical security team. Team members are often deployed and can test your technology or service in a real world environment.</p>
            
            <p>Technical security teams are managed by the Joint Information Assurance Co-ordination Cell (JIACC).</p>
            
            <p>On MODNET, search for 'JAICC'.</p>

            <h3>Cyber Resilience Programme</h3>

            <p>If your project is a priority and considered high risk, you can ask for support from the Cyber Resilience Programme (CRP). They use external security experts for activities including:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>bug bounties</li>
              <li>red team events</li>
              <li>Vulnerability Disclosure Programmes (VDPs)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On MODNET, search for the 'Cyber Resilience Programme'.</p>

            <h3>Cyber Security Advisory and Assurance Service</h3>

            <p>Any project in Defence can get advice from the Cyber Security Advisory and Assurance Service (CySAAS) consultancy service.</p>
            
            <p>For example, you have done a pen test but you have questions about the real-world impact of a specific issue.</p>
          
            <p>On MODNET, search for 'CySAAS consultancy'.</p>
